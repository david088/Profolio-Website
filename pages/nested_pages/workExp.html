                    Skinalytics is a start-up company where I am contributing in creating an Androd app helping users to find and match skin products based on their skin types. 
                    As an intern, my responsiblity lies in compeleting the tasks with quality and presenting the tasks in weekly meetings. Through meetings, I listen 
                    to manager and owner's feedbacks to fix and improve upon my tasks. Until now, I have created user centered app interfaces and funtionalities that allow users
                    to observe and manage their followers; and create auto filled product review page for quick access navigation buttons. From it, I obtained knowledge in 
                    professional workflows, workstyle, and communication skills. Improved in skills in critical-thinking, debugging, creating efficient algorithms, and writting 
                    meaningful comments.

                    Cupertino High School was the first institution I attented in the United States. During the time, I was an athlete in the wrestling team 
                    Though this sport is extremly tough, my competitive nature drives me forward. With my coaches and teammates's help, I improved quickly, 
                    and was qualified to CCS in my second year of wrestling . After graduating, I decided to go back to the team becoming an assistant coach 
                    to pay back to the community where I grew. My responsiblity was to teaching techniques and leading wrestlers to weekly tournaments. During the 
                    first year of coach, the team won first place as a team in final, and I recieved Coach Award for showing outstanding leaderships.
