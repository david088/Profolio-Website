            Hey, it's David. <br> <br>
            I am a Computer Science student studying at UCSD. Moving to the United States at age 15, 
            with no previous experience in CS until college, going into my first CS class was somewhat 
            fearsome, but I fall in love with coding right when I finish my first programming assignment. 
            I love facing challenges and enjoy the moments when I cracked the code. During this process, 
            it is never boring as we keep learning when facing any unknown, then obtaining the knowledge  
            when concurring the obstacles. I enjoy every moment of it. That takes me to keep pursuing CS. 
            Hoping to become a Software Engineer or a Full-Stack Engineer to apply what I learned to 
            contribute to projects that solve problems and benefit people's lives. 
            <br><br>
            Besides coding, my hobby has always been drawing. It allows me to express my mind in visual  
            formats. Each line, color, and the different combinations. Together, they tell a story. Even 
            the smallest details, could make the difference in day and night. I have always looked for 
            improvement by focusing on details to elevate the visual experience and my professional field.
