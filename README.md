### Visit My Webiste at web-phase4.firebaseapp.com
The webiste is built using programming languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript to show my past expereince in working in tech and hobby outside of my professinal field.
It includes pages such as "Work Experience", "Past Projects", "Art", "About Me", etc. to help you learn more about me that is not included in the resume.

During the design and programming phrases, I used User-Center Design process and wish it can provide a good user experience to the viewers. Furthermore, CSS and Javascript were used to ensure a responsive design as it fits both computer and mobile device screen sizes. 

Additionally, some pages were created for further practice in Javascript by implement customized dialogs and a simple blog page that requires verification from Google account in order to post.
